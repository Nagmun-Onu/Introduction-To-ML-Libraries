# Introduction-To-Ml-Libraries
This repository is dedicated to practicing different tasks with pandas. 
It should be noted there may be more than one different way to answer a question or complete an exercise.
Exercises are based off (and directly taken from) the quick introduction to pandas notebook Zero-to-mastery-ml udemy course.
For further reference and resources, it's advised to check out the pandas documentation.

# Extensions
For more exercises, check out the pandas documentation, particularly the 10-minutes to pandas section.

One great exercise would be to retype out the entire section into a Jupyter Notebook of your own.

Get hands-on with the code and see what it does.
